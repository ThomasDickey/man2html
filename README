RELEASE NOTES

    This is the v3 release.  The reason for the increment of the
    major version number (from v2) is that man2html will run only
    under Perl 5.  man2html is no longer compatible with Perl 4.
    Along with the change to Perl 5, several enhancments have been
    made.  See the CHANGES file for a summary.

---------------------------------------------------------------------------
INSTALLATION

    To install man2html, type the following command:

	% perl install.me

    The installation process will ask you a series of questions on
    where the Perl executable is and where to put man2html.  Just hit
    <CR> to accept the default values listed in ()'s.

    Notes on installation process:

	o  The '#!' line in the installed man2html program is set
	   to point to the Perl executable specified in the
	   installation process.

	o  If you specify paths that do not exist, the install.me
	   program will create the path.

	o  man.cgi must be installed manually into you HTTP server's
	   cgi-bin directory.  Read the start of man.cgi for any
	   site specific changes that may be required for proper
	   execution.

---------------------------------------------------------------------------
DOCUMENTATION

    A manpage for man2html gets installed as part of the installation
    process.  The HTML, test, and PostScript versions of the
    documentation (dervied from the manpage) are also provided in the
    doc directory, but are not automatically installed by "install.me".
